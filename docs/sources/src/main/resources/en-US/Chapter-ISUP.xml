		<para>The ISDN User Part (ISUP) defines the protocol used to set-up, manage, and release trunk circuits that carry voice and data between terminating line exchanges (e.g., between a calling party and a called party). ISUP is used for both ISDN and non-ISDN calls. However, calls that originate and terminate at the same switch do not use ISUP signaling.</para>
