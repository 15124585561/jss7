		<para>TCAP supports the exchange of non-circuit related data between
			applications across the SS7 network using the SCCP connectionless
			service. Queries and responses sent between SSPs and SCPs are carried
			in TCAP messages. For example, an SSP sends a TCAP query to determine
			the routing number associated with a dialed 800/888 number and to
			check the personal identification number (PIN) of a calling card
			user. In mobile networks (IS-41 and GSM), TCAP carries Mobile
			Application Part (MAP) messages sent between mobile switches and
			databases to support user authentication, equipment identification,
			and roaming.</para>
