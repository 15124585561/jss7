	<title>SS7 Simulator</title>

	<para>
		SS7 Simulator is an application for testing SS7 stack and displaying its functionality.
		It is also a good example of how to use this stack. 
	</para>

	<para>
		SS7 Simulator contains three layers of SS7 stack components and one testing task layer which presents the concrete testing task. 
	</para>

	<para>
		Layer 1 presents MTP-3 corresponded stack. It can be one of:
			<itemizedlist> 
				<listitem>
					<para>
						M3UA
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						ISUP (not yet implemented)

				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
		A user can select for testing layers that he needs.
		Some layers demand correct low layers. For example TCAP+MAP layer demands SCCP as layer 2.
		Each layer can be separately configured depending on user testing tasks.
		Configuring of layers covers only major options (does not cover all possible SS7 stack options). 
	</para>
	
	<section id="simulator_configuring">
		<title>SS7 Simulator configuring 
		</title>

	<para>
		After compiling Simulator binaries can be found in the folder simulator/bootstrap/target/simulator-ss7.
		Use "run.bat" or "run.sh" command file for running Simulator (from a folder simulator/bootstrap/target/simulator-ss7/bin).
	</para>

	<para>
		You can run several instances of Simulator from one folder.
		Each of this instances can have its own configuration options.
		Configuration options are saved into an xml configuration file.
		Each running instance has its own name (called "host name") and the name of configuration file depends on this host name.
		For example if the host name is "a1", the name of the configuration file will be "a1_simulator.xml".
		Each running Simulator instance must have different host name in order to each running Simulator instance can have different options.  
	</para>

	<para>
		Before running a test all layers must be configured.
		After test running a user can perform some actions depending on the test.
		Results of a test are emitted as "notifications". 
		Notifications are displayed in GUI interface of Simulator and Jconsole application (also GUI interface) and also are written into a file "&LT;host name&GT;.log" and into a console.
	</para>

	<para>
		You can run and manage SS7 Simulator locally or remotely.
		If you are running Simulator locally you are using a GUI interface. 
		If you are running Simulator remotely you can use RMI access (via a GUI interface) and HTML interface (using a HTML Browser).
	</para>

	
	<section id="simulator_configuring_locally">
		<title>SS7 Simulator locally running
		</title>

	<para>
		In order to run SS7 Simulator locally you must run a command "run gui" (from a folder simulator/bootstrap/target/simulator-ss7/bin). 
		You can pass the only parameter which is the "host name". Possible examples (host name is "a1"): 
		<programlisting>
		run gui -na1
		run gui --name=a1
		</programlisting>
		The GUI application form "Connecting to a testerHost ..." will appear. You have to fill "Host name" field (if it is empty),
		select "Create a local testerHost" option and press "Start" button. The local Simulator host will be run.   
	</para>

	</figure>

	<para>
		The form "SS7 Simulator: &LT;host name&GT;-local" appears.
		The next step is selecting modules for layers 1-3 and a testing task and configuring modules (by pressing buttons "...").
		Button "Save" is used for saving options to the disk, button "Reload" is used for reloading options from a disk.
		When layer configuring you can press one of two buttons "Load default values for side A" and 
		"Load default values for side B" for loading default values for testing.
		These default values can be used if you are using SS7 Simulators in the one computer host
		as the side A and the side B for interaction.

	<para>
		After configuring press a button "Run test".
		The form for testing will be displayed.
		In the upper part of this form the information of layers and test state is displayed.
		This information is refreshed every 5 seconds and can be refreshed manually by "Refresh state" button pressing.
		After pressing "Start" button all modules are started and ready for test, after pressing "Stop" button all modules are stopped.
		In the central part of the form notifications from testing modules are displayed.  
		In the lower part of the form test depended information are allocated. Details of this part is displayed in the corresponded test definition.

	<section id="simulator_configuring_remotely">
		<title>SS7 Simulator remotely running 
		</title>

	<para>
		Now there are two interfaces for managing: RMI and HTML adapter. Both two styles of management can be run at the same time.  
	</para>

	<para>
		For launching Simulator remotely we should firstly run a tester host. The format of launching a tester host is:  
		<programlisting>
		run core -na1 -t8001 -r9999
		</programlisting>
		or
		<programlisting>
		run core --name=a1 --http=8001 --rmi=9999
		</programlisting>
		Options "-n" (or "--name=") defines a host name ("a1").
		Options "-r" (or "--rmi=") defines a port for rmi requests listerning (9999).
		Options "-t" (or "--http=") defines a port for html requests listerning (8001).
		You can use only rmi or only http connectors or both.
	</para>


	<section id="simulator_configuring_remotely_rmi">
		<title>RMI interface
		</title>

	<para>
		The best client for management via RMI interface is the GUI interface of Simulator.
		It can be launched by the same way as we launch Simulator locally: 
		<programlisting>
		run gui
		</programlisting>
		After launching we should select the option "Connect to the existing testerHost via JMX" and
		in the default RMI connection string replace "localhost" with the proper IP address of the tester host computer
		and the "9999" with the proper RMI port (the port from option "-r" or "--rmi=") (if needed).
		After connecting the management will be the same as if the application is run locally (see <xref linkend="simulator_configuring_locally" />).

	<para>
		"Jconsole" application can be also used as the client. But this application is less convenient.  
	</para>
	</section>


	<section id="simulator_configuring_remotely_html">
		<title>HTPL interface 
		</title>

	<para>
		HTML management is less convenient than RMI management. But it can be used if RMI is not acceptable (for example if we are behind a proxy).
		For paramters configuring and luanching tests we can use any html browser. Use "http://&LT;IP address&GT;:&LT;port&GT;" as an URL.
		The port is defined in "-t" or "--http=" options.

	</figure>
		"TesterHost" is a main MBean in which we can select the mode for test working, start/stop testing (buttoms "Start"/"Stop"),
		quit a tester host (buttom "quit"). Use other beans for setting options for layers and test tasks.

	<para>
		Several test cases are implemened now. 
	</para>


	<section id="simulator_test_ussdclient">
		<title>USSD Client 
		</title>

	<para>
		UssdClient test can perform followng tasks:
			<itemizedlist> 
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Sending a ProcessUnstructiredSs request, waiting for the answer and displaying the answer 
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

						Spectial case for load testing: Sending to the Ussd server a flow of ProcessUnstructiredSs requests without stopping (and receiving responses).
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
		For working in a manual mode select the option "Manual operation", for auto sending nessages - the option "Auto sending ProcessUnstructuredSSRequest".  
		You can send ProcessUnstructiredSs request and UnstructiredSs response only manually by inserting a message text and 
		pressing buttons.
		For working in the auto mode you should define the string of auto processUnstructuredSs request and the count of maximum active MAP dialogs (default value is 10).
		The more dialogs is defined the more messages per second will be sent.
		Msisdn, data coding schema and alerting pattern values should be also configured before test starting.
		For auto mode we recomment to check the option "One notification for 100 dialogs" for preventing too many notifications when load testing. 
	</para>

	<para>
		You can send ProcessUnstructiredSs request and UnstructiredSs response manually by inserting a message text and 
		pressing buttons.
		You can not send a new ProcessUnstructiredSs request till the response for previos request has been received (or till dialog timeout).
		You can also manually close the current dialog by perssing "Close current dialog" button.

	<section id="simulator_test_ussdserver">
		<title>USSD Server 
		</title>

	<para>
		UssdServer test can work in manual and automatic modes.
		In the manual mode a user manually inserts the response message value and sends ProcessUnstructiredSs response (or UnstructiredSs request) to the Ussd client.
		In the automatic mode UssdServer automatically sends a predefined message as an ProcessUnstructiredSs response ("Auto sending ProcessUnstructuredSsResponse" option)
		or automatically sends a predefined message as an UnstructiredSs request and then 
		sends a predefined message ProcessUnstructiredSs response ("Auto sending Unstructured_SS_Request then after response sending ProcessUnstructuredSsResponse" option).
		Use "Auto sending ProcessUnstructuredSsResponse" option for UssdServer if UssdClient is used for a load test ("Auto sending ProcessUnstructuredSSRequest").
		For load testst we recomment to check the option "One notification for 100 dialogs" for preventing too many notifications when load testing.
