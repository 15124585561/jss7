	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		has modular design. Each protocol has its own separate module. This
		module depends only on its provider - that is for instance
		<acronym>SCCP</acronym>
		depends only from
		<acronym>MTP</acronym>
		and
		<acronym>TCAP</acronym>
		depends on
		<acronym>SCPP</acronym>.
		This makes it easy to customize whole &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;.
		Specific protocol module has list of all dependencies along with
		information on general design. Please refer to module description for
		more information.
