		The
		<acronym>ISDN</acronym>
		User Part (
		<acronym>ISUP</acronym>
		) defines the protocol used to set-up,
		manage, and release trunk
		circuits that carry voice and data between
		terminating line exchanges
		(e.g., between a calling party and a
		called party).
		<acronym>ISUP</acronym>
		is used for both
		<acronym>ISDN</acronym>
		and non-
		<acronym>ISDN</acronym>
		calls.
		However, calls that originate and terminate at the same switch
		do not
		use
		<acronym>ISUP</acronym>
		signaling.

	<para>
		<acronym>ISUP</acronym>
		is defined in
		<acronym>ITU-T</acronym>
		<literal>Q.763</literal>
		specification.
