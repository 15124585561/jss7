		<para><acronym>TCAP</acronym> supports the exchange of non-circuit related data between
			applications across the <acronym>SS7</acronym> network using the <acronym>SCCP</acronym> connectionless
			service. Queries and responses sent between SSPs and SCPs are carried
			in TCAP messages. For example, an SSP sends a <acronym>TCAP</acronym> query to determine
			the routing number associated with a dialed 800/888 number and to
			check the personal identification number (<acronym>PIN</acronym>) of a calling card
			user. In mobile networks (IS-41 and <acronym>GSM</acronym>), <acronym>TCAP</acronym> carries Mobile
			Application Part (<acronym>MAP</acronym>) messages sent between mobile switches and
			databases to support user authentication, equipment identification,
			and roaming.</para>
			<para>
			<acronym>TCAP</acronym> messages and parameters are refered as <literal>primitives</literal>. Primitives are exchanged 
				within logical entity called dialog. There are two types of dialogs:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Unstructured - short lived, it is created only to deliver single message (<literal>Unstructured primitive</literal>), after delivery dialog is invalidated. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Structured - long lived, it is created when exchange starts and lives until it is terminated. </para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>
				<acronym>TCAP</acronym> defines following message types:
			</para>			
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unstructured - creates Unstructured dialog. Unstructured dialog is invalidated once this message is either sent or consumed. It is meant for messages which dont require answer or interaction.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Begin - message sent to begin Structured dialog, it carries context information for dialog being created</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Continue - continues Structured dialog</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>End - ends Structured dialog in graceful way</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Abort - aborts Structured dialog</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para><acronym>TCAP</acronym> messages convey two types of information:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>components - elements which carry information on requested operation, their status and result.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>dialog related - dialog context(application context name) and application specific information(user information)</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
